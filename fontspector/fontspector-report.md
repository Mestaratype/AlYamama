    <summary>⚠️ <b>WARN</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours. (contour_count)</summary>
    <div>








- ⚠️ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are
     infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a
     large collection of reference font families. The divergences
     listed below may simply indicate a significantly different
     design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these
     may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an
     incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and
     codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.
